# Thesis on A-System-for-real-time-facial-emotion-recognition

This thesis presents a comprehensive study on the development of a real-time facial emotion recognition system using transfer learning on the MobileNetV2 architecture and the FER-2013 dataset. To address the challenge of accurately recognizing emotions from facial expressions,  we fine-tune the pre-trained MobileNetV2 model on the FER-2013 dataset using transfer learning. <br>

### What we have done
1. Developed a system using a transfer learning approach to identify different facial expressions(happy, sad, angry, surprise, disgust) in real-time. <br>
2. Used transfer learning on MobileNetV2(a CNN based architecture) architecture. <br>
3. Fine-tuned the pre-trained MobileNetV2 model on the FER-2013 dataset. <br>
4. Integrated the system in real-time video using OpenCV and Haarcascade  libraries. <br>
